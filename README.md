## How it Works ?
Most of the first years stepping into the campus are clueless of where to lock their hostels and with whom.
CUSAT University hostels provide hostel rooms just for around 3 by 5 of the students in School of Engineering. This forces the students to try private hostels in or outside the campus. Being beginners in the city, itâ€™s being a hectic task for them to find a room partner for them and a better hostel space.
Freshers also face problems in selecting an appropriate food mess or to find good restaurants in the campus surroundings..
Parents worried, no idea regarding the food and accommodation available in the campus, struggles to get some seniors contacts and ask them, no guarantee if the senior knows about the place well.
